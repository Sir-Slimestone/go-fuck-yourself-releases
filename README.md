This is Go Fuck Yourself! Minecraft's hardest datapack!

Go Fuck Yourself is designed for Minecraft 1.20.4

Go Fuck Yourself buffs and adds mechanics to almost all of the hostile mobs in the games and number of other mobs.
Go Fuck Yourself also changes progression to make the game more difficult and adds multiple natural hazards with varying lethality.

If you play Go Fuck Yourself death will be extremely common, this datapack is not forgiving and it is not fair. Prepare to be obliterated.
Do not play Go Fuck Yourself in hardcore, you will die a lot, often with precious little you could do about it. Hardcore probably isn't possible.

Installation of this datapack is like any other datapack, just be sure to install Go Fuck Yourself during world creation using the main .zip in releases.
Go Fuck Yourself also comes with a resourcepack which adds a handful of custom death messages, there are no changed textures.
Adding the resourcepack must be done seperatly from the datapack due to how Minecraft handles clientside vs serverside. It is like installing any other resourcepack.
Go Fuck Yourself's resourcepack can be added before or after world creation, and will have no effect on worlds that do not have Go Fuck Yourself.
